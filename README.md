## Learnings and Insights

### Geolocation & Leaflet.JS

Prior to this project, I did not know anything about [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) which is a JavaScript library that helps developers create interactive and mobile-friendly maps. But now, I am able to grab the current coordinates of a user through the help of Leaflet.JS & Leaflet Locate Control.

Leaflet.JS, as far as I know, just provides you with an easy interactive mobile-friendly map. The thing that helped me actually locate the user's geolocation was [Leaflet Locate Control](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol). 

The tools I got to kind of mess around with in Leaflet include:

- Markers
- Popups
- TileLayers (this helps you change the skin of the map)

In Leaflet Locate Control, I learned how to automatically locate the user's location without the need to press any buttons using the `start()` method. Then, I utilize the `stop()` method once the user's location has successfully been found.

### Styling

I think that with this project I truly got to understand the importance of containers and setting max-widths for both visually appealing large-screened desktops & mobile-friendly websites. I can't say I have the box-model thing down 100%, but I can say that with developer tools and a stubborn "I must get this to work and look pretty" attitude, I can create any website.

Oh. I now know how to do icons + text for navbars!  🍭

## Next Steps & Possible To-Dos

- [ ] Update products page to cards
- [ ] Either remove pretty link blocks because of fixed nav, make navbar height smaller, or remove fixed nav styling
- [ ] Add more fun animations :)

The next step for this project could be to build out the products page more. For example, rather than using a collapsible accordion (required), I would use cards to list each item in a grid-like system. Fleshing that out a step further, I would create the cards with JavaScript so that whenever I have a new item, it will automatically create it for me and add it straight onto the page.

## Recent Changes
